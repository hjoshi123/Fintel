            "post_title": "DD: I DD'd the nvidia run up last year ($250->$700) and was right. Now I have a new prediction",
            "body": "Here's my nvidia DD from last year (NVDA was $250 and I predicted $700 within a year): [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/13lb98n/dd\\_nvda\\_to\\_700\\_by\\_this\\_time\\_next\\_year/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/13lb98n/dd_nvda_to_700_by_this_time_next_year/)\n\nLast week I timed the exit on my BTC and QQQ holdings fairly well. **Now I'm setting my sights on a new horizon: AMD**\n\nAMD is sort of like the nice ugly step sister of hot bae nvidia. Everyone \"likes\" her, but she doesn't get invited to parties and no one takes her seriously. Right now reminds me of Ryzen 1. When AMD was $12, I predicted AMD's stock price would triple in the next two years due to how well the architecture fit with datacenter needs. I posted my DD here and was right. It took most people by surprise because at the time Intel had 99% of the datacenter CPU market. Now we look at $180+ AMD price. I think we are once again going to be surprised by su bae and co.\n\nI'll get to my evidence that AMD will exceed expectations yet again, but first I want to address some obvious points of skepticism.\n\n1. **Firstly AMD's seemingly absurd P/E ratio of 364:** I'm going to show that not only is AMD's revenue going to go up by an absurd amount in the next year, but also its net income margin. Nvidia operates at around 50% income right now and AMD is operating at around 20% right now. That gap is going to close considerably in the next year. I'm estimating AMD will reach around 35-40% net income. On top of that AMD will grow revenue by 50% in the next year (wishful thinking would say as high as 70% more revenue) exclusively due to AI accelerators. This will all lead to considerably more realistic P/E ratio.\n2. **Next Nvidia's control on the market:** The evidence points to this being a detriment to Nvidia. AI companies are looking to diversify from Nvidia because they don't want to be vendor-locked, Nvidia has a 1 year back order on its top AI accelerators, and Nvidia's massive profit margin makes it easy to undercut their price. Furthermore, CUDA dominance is highly exaggerated today. I use this stuff every day, and ROCm is absolutely production ready, especially for large companies who have the staff to optimize for it. The people who say ROCm sucks haven't used it in a while -- AMD is working on it at a break neck pace.\n\n# Now on to my DD\n\nThe debate about AMD's price largely boils down to its newest AI accelerator's value (the MI300X) versus Nvidia's current AI accelerator (the H100). AI accelerators are now most of the accelerator market (including GPUs), and also have the highest profit margins by far, so they are basically 80% of the valuation on these companies' stock prices. Yes the H200 and the new GB200 are coming out soon for Nvidia, but the MI300X has a timing lead on them which enables it to get some foothold. So for the moment, its MI300X vs H100 for companies deciding what to buy.\n\n**Accelerator Value:** Reviews for the MI300X are going to come out imminently (within a few weeks), and we will begin seeing hard evidence for its value proposition then. I have spent a lot of time on older AMD cards analyzing their performance versus big green. My findings are that generally AMD is capable of being as fast or faster than Nvidia, but most open source projects are optimized better for Nvidia so in the real world AMD has a performance disadvantage. However in the case of the MI300X, its raw performance is so large over an H100, it will likely produce slightly better real world performance. Also the MI300X is selling for around $25k per card (you can buy it right now [https://www.thinkmate.com/system/a+-server-8125gs-tnmr2](https://www.thinkmate.com/system/a+-server-8125gs-tnmr2)) where the H100 is around $40k, so companies will be looking at benchmarks in a couple weeks that point to the MI300X being slightly faster and considerably less expensive.\n\n**Nvidia supply constraint:** Nvidia has a back order of around a year for their latest AI accelerators. This means if a company needs to immediately purchase accelerators for a new project, they simply can't from Nvidia at scale. AMD's order books are currently open, but probably filling fast for this reason.\n\n**Announced customers:** Meta is going to be the largest customer for the MI300X. They have indirectly announced that they will purchase up to almost half of their 600k accelerators this year from AMD ([https://www.theregister.com/2024/02/02/meta\\_ai\\_chips/](https://www.theregister.com/2024/02/02/meta_ai_chips/)). This customer alone will add 25% to AMD's revenue and improve their profit margin from 20% to roughly 28%. MS has already started deploying the MI300X on Azure and Oracle has announced they will launch VMs with them, but neither has announced numbers. Who won't be using AMD? OpenAI has a multi-year contract with nvidia, and Google uses their own proprietary TPU.\n\n**AI accelerator headwind:** The AI accelerator market is expected to have a CAGR of over 20% for the next 5+ years. This means there will be continued supply constraints that incentivize diversifying hardware. New players inherently have an advantage because of this. It just happens that AMD is the next new player to be mature and scaled enough for widespread adoption. Yes Intel and startups will probably do fine also, but AMD is seeing ridiculous growth at this very moment that hasn't appeared on their earnings report yet (fulfillment for the MI300X did not ramp up until roughly January). There is such a ridiculous amount of demand in this ai accelerator market that everyone in it will grow.\n\n# My price target: $450 AMD\n\nAfter doing some napkin math on the market, I think it is reasonable for AMD to acquire 15-20% of the AI accelerator market by the end of the year, up from an inconsequential market share before. This includes speculation about AMD's product competitiveness, their ability to scale, the customers that will be interested in buying AMD, market growth, and new Nvidia product launches. Extrapolating that marketshare into net income by using a rough margin per card and using Nvidia's P/E ratio as a baseline model, translates to an AMD fair stock price of around $450 by the end of the year.\n\nAMD's price will start to go up after the MI300X reviews come out and rumors of their customer acquisitions come in. The May earnings report will be where it starts to appear on their books, but they are still ramping up right now and Q2 is where we will see the largest earnings growth.\n\n**My positions are: $190 6/21C and $200 10/18C**\n\nThat's all. See you later this year.",

Samsung and Intel could poop on TSMCs party, which would hit both NVDA and AMD.  NVIDIA is in a position it can price their GPUs at any value now since it\u2019s like a gold rush. Once the market stabilizes amd can easily eat into that market share along with Intel, if they assert process leadership. The DD of $450 is slightly aggressive, AMd so far has minimal market share in the GPU business, the main constraint in scaling is going to be the heating and packaging. Intel with its backside power delivery could show significant improvement and Intel already leads the packaging space. As I have previously mentioned AMD and NVDA are at the mercy of TSMC to solve the heating issues, which as you scale are going to overshadow any performance benefits.",

The analysis points to several factors supporting AMD's potential growth:\n\n    P/E Ratio and Financial Performance: The post discusses AMD's high P/E ratio (364) but argues it will become more reasonable within a year due to a substantial increase in revenue (50-70%) and net income margin (from 20% to 35-40%), primarily driven by AI accelerators.\n\n    Market Dynamics and Competition: It mentions NVIDIA's current market dominance as potentially detrimental due to vendor lock-in concerns and supply chain constraints. The author argues that AMD's AI technology (ROCm) is underestimated and is catching up to NVIDIA's CUDA in terms of functionality and performance.\n\n    AI Accelerator Market and AMD's Position: The focus is on the value proposition of AMD's MI300X AI accelerator compared to NVIDIA's H100, highlighting AMD's competitive pricing and performance. Supply constraints on NVIDIA's side are seen as an opportunity for AMD to gain market share.\n\n    Customer Acquisition and Market Growth: The analysis includes significant expected deals and customer shifts towards AMD, including a large order from Meta and deployments by Microsoft and Oracle. The AI accelerator market's rapid growth is seen as a tailwind for AMD.\n\n    Price Target and Investment Strategy: The author sets a price target of $450 for AMD stock, based on expected market share gains in the AI accelerator market and comparisons to NVIDIA's financial metrics. The post concludes with the author's personal investment positions indicating a strong belief in AMD's stock performance in the near term.\n\nThis analysis combines financial metrics, market dynamics, and specific product comparisons to build a case for AMD's stock appreciation, reflecting both the author's expertise and bullish stance on AMD.",

Despite skepticism about AMD's high P/E ratio and Nvidia's market dominance, the author believes AMD will exceed expectations. The MI300X is expected to offer better performance at a lower price than Nvidia's H100, and AMD can fulfill orders while Nvidia has a year-long backlog. Major customers like Meta are already adopting AMD's technology. The author predicts AMD will capture 15-20% of the AI accelerator market by year-end, leading to a fair stock price of $450. The author has call options on AMD at $190 and $200 strike prices.",
                "And\u2026. H100s have lead times of like 6 months & B100s won\u2019t even be publicly available for > 1.5-2 years. At the end of the day, it\u2019s likely that consumers would rather buy an AMD GPU w/ slightly worse performance compared to the top end NVIDIA GPU due to delivery times. Production is out of NVIDIA\u2019s hands to a certain extent. The only problem is that once code is optimized for NVIDIA architecture, reworking the model to fit AMD architecture is extremely time consuming, to the point where people may as well just wait for the NVIDIA GPUs with insane lead times. The thing is, companies can say they want to avoid vendor lock in as much as they want, but when they tell that to the researchers and developers who will have to rework their codes to be compatible with AMD GPUs, I doubt they\u2019ll garner much support (if any). I think AMD stock price will do very well too over the next few years but NVIDIA will probably lead this space for years to come. This is a long road though so really only time will tell..",

Child's play compared to the exponential mindfuckery that's brewing.\n\nOnce artificial superintelligence arrives, it's game over for you smooth-brained apes still YOLOing on meme stocks. The ASI will analyze the markets with the processing power of 69,420 autist brains and then proceed to 4D chess the financial system into total submission. SPY $4206.90 EOY.\n\nSo which stocks will be the horse cock winners in our robot overlord future?\n\n$NVDA, $AMD - no shit, Captain Obvious. These guys make the silicon dildos powering the AI revolution. They'll keep printing tendies even after SkyNet goes live.\n\n$GOOG, $AMZN - if the AI doesn't kill us all, it'll still need to advertise shit and sell us more useless crap we don't need. Goog and Bezos will happily plug into the AI hive mind. literal cannot go tits up.\n\n$TSLA - Papa Elon's galaxy brain will either merge with the AI god and become an immortal cyborg, or get his ass absolutely clapped when the AI concludes humans are obsolete. Either way, TSLA to $42,069. Funding secured.\n\nTL;DR: We're all fucked in the long run but you can still profit in the short term before the AI takes over.

            "body": "First off, I was up $38,000 between mid February and 3/8.\n\nMy nightmare started on 3/8 at  beginning of market. I opened the following positions:\n\n4/19 NVDA $1100c x3\n\n4/19 NVDA $1200c x20\n\n4/19 SPY $525c x20\n\nEverything started great, was up $25k at 520am local time. Went for a morning run at 530am. Came home an hour later and looked at my portfolio to see the massive decline NVDA took from the $974 ATH moments before my run to an hour later. In a panic, I opened more positions:\n\n3/15 NVDA $920c x5\n\n3/15 SPY $515 X20\n\nMy cost basis was now around $75k. Completely over leveraged and overwhelmed. There was one day, Tuesday 3/12, where I could have closed my 3/15 NVDA calls after JPOW gave CPI report and everything bounced, but I missed it due to a work meeting. NVDA was up $30 overnight, but fell hard before market open.\n\nAt one point, I was $50k down and internally freaking the fuck out. I never meant to be so far leveraged, losing my entire 38k gain, and losing another 12k-15k. I fucked up, bad.\n\nLong story short, I was able to close all my SPY positions for a small gain. But, my NVDA options were so far OTM, and I bought when NVDA was around $960, that theta and IV just crushed them.\n\nAll positions are finally closed, and I lost 35k. Somehow, I am still up about $2700 for the year, and I'll fucking take it. I lost the gains that I won by being greedy, getting lucky, and putting my family's hard earned fucking money on the line.\n\nI experienced - first fucking hand - exactly what happens when you're over leveraged and a trade turns against you. I should have taken that God damn 25k gain on the morning of 3/8.\n\nI have learned so, so much from digging deep within myself the past couple weeks and suffering internal shame, guilt, stress, frustration, etc., but also being serious about what I did wrong, and how to avoid such disaster. \n\nDo not get greedy. Take the fucking profit. You can always reenter.\n\nSet a fucking stop loss.\n\nDo not purchase 75k worth of options if you do not want to lose 75k,  because you absolutely can lose the whole God damn thing.\n\nTake a fucking loss and close a losing position. Do not continue to \"hope\" things will turn around. A losing position is a loser. Deal with it.\n\nDo not listen to the fucking idiots on Reddit with their bullshit posts saying \"NVDA part deux electric bugaloo to the fucking moon by Friday\". People don't know fuck all about fuck all. \n\nThere it is. What a fucking shit show. Time to slow down, relax, and try again. \n\nRoast away...",

Genuinely a good outcome considering people have offed themselves for losing from massive overleveraged bets using all their moms/spouse's money.\n\nThe one lesson I like to reiterate is that derivatives are a trillion dollar industry with many private equity, hedge funds, and institutions employing thousands of smart PhD Math nerds and cutting edge purchasing of every order flow, transactions, spending $$$ to get even nano-seconds of data and transaction advantage over the market and retail.\n\nMost big retail wins on these are purely coincidental luck at best, and winning usually comes from just something wildly unforseen and/or some news that comes up well after the chips are already placed on the table -- weeks or months in advance. \n\nFor big ones like NVDA, you are not going to win out without just massive dumb luck because there's orgs with massive more resources and funding to make sure they squeeze out as much as possible, and who have reasonable probabilities of the tops and movements, and you are but a worthless rube with an open-wallet to hold the bag.  If you're already playing long after it's moved and hit the spotlight, your chances at winning are purely dumb luck at that point. Might have an easier time playing smaller less media-spotlighted that dont have the eye of sauron on them.",

That's when you dig deep and re-examine your investing strategy for soundness and sanity. Generally speaking, buying options rarely benefits the purchaser. You'll see posts on WSB about people who made sick gainz from options trading, but just remember: it's all survivor bias. For ever 1 who posts a gain porn post on options, there are 19 quiet losers. 95% of options players lose their money. It's not necessarily because they are wrong about the direction the market is going to go, but they have to precisely time the market as well. Nobody is any good at accurately timing the market, so if you're playing an options game based on market timings, either go for a long horizon or take a seat and think long and hard about what you're about to do and why, and be prepared to eat your hat. Don't gamble on options with money you can't afford to lose -- greed will kill you every time.",

            "body": "This is a bit of a shower thought but if we are looking for signs of a pull back in equity markets I do wonder if using BTC as a signal has any value.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBTC hit its peak of about 62.5k in mid November of 2021\n\nTowards the end of January 2022 it had crashed all the way down to 35k, a 44% drop. \n\nIt would continue to fall until November of 2022 and stagnated at the bottom until January of 2023. \n\nIt would not make an ATH again until mid March 2024.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe S&P hit it's peak on December 30th of 2021 at 4800. \n\nBy end of January it had only dropped to \\~4300, a 10.5% drop. \n\nThe S&P hit it's bottom in mid October 2022. The market did not languish here and by November it had already risen 14% from its low. \n\nIt made a new ATH late January 2024.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf we accept the idea that BTC is a volatile speculative and risky asset this all makes total sense. Risky assets are the first to be dumped when a bearish turn around in markets is happening. They are the last to be bought back into when markets turn bullish again. So the fact that BTC dumped first and hardest and then lagged the market all through the bull run makes perfect sense. \n\nFrom what I can see looking back to November/ December 2021 Jpow was beginning to signal a turn. The fed had stopped buying bonds, and by December was talking about a change in strategy to rate hikes. So this all lines up with investors feeling the changing of the winds and dumping risky speculative asset classes. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo the question is can you use BTC as an early warning sign that equity markets are about to take a dive?\n\nI think its a valid enough thing to consider. The current top in BTC and the rather large drop it's taken over the past week (-12% over past 5 days) all while equity markets trade sideways at ATH and certain leading stocks (NVDA) sit at the top of their chart patterns is concerning. A pullback has felt inevitable for a while now in the S&P but timing seems like a fools errand. \n\nThe BTC drop is by no technical means a bear market for BTC yet. It would really depend where you want to view your areas of support. Do you call 62k support? 51k? 43-39k?  I have no clue how you would evaluate BTC other than TA since it literally has nothing else going on but price movement. \n\nIf you continued to see BTC plummet downwards you could view it as a bearish signal for equity markets. I know you guys love trading short term shit off sentiment so i'll leave an absolutely regarded TLDR.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TLDR: if BTC falls below 60k buy 490 strike price puts on SPY with 30-90 day expiry.** ",

Like regulatory aspects or some big player going down (again). Some days I had a feeling you can also see some money pulled from BTC that then went into other hype/speculative stuff like NVDA.

            "body": "Fiends and family across the globe,\n\nLast week I was beginning to believe we were about to enter a correction. I was mistaken. The markets are instead primed for an \"erection\".\n\nWhy? Well, for one I've been watching AAPL quite closely recently. The shadow puppeteers of the market threw out some headlines to pump and dump it this week. AAPL trying to get some AI on their phones with partnerships from Google and chinese companies. AAPL getting sued by Biden admin cuz Trump says he likes to suck off Tim Cook on his CNBC interview. Do these headlines truly affect price though? I doubt it. If there was such concern, their market makers wouldn't have taken the risk to stick AAPL to 172.5 (strike price) over the weekend.\n\nIf you follow AAPL closely, you'll notice these guys actually have so much control over their own stock price they regularly burn both sides on earnings. Opex almost always settles at max pain. Not only do they control their stock price, they control the Chinese and American governments. Their stock is a little bit down, but it hasn't diminished their power nor influence. They're still one of the biggest indirect employers in China via their supply lines. In the US they have mind control over about half the population of adult voters and are one of the largest sources of tax revenue.\n\nSO WHY THE FUCK IS AAPL's STOCK DOWN RELATIVE TO THE MARKET!? It's simple. There needs to be an area of intense consolidation for investors to really dial into pushing price higher. Nobody wants to load AAPL at 200 to push for their next step at like 220-230. They want it at 170. That's a much better risk proposition.\n\nNVDA is leading the way and will probably top out at like 5000 or something. Yup, a 13 trillion dollar valuation. The thing is the market just has no chill when it comes to understanding this next wave of economic gains is going to replace most of the workforce by 2030 and businesses won't have to deal with payroll anymore, just taxes. It's gonna be a world just like the Hunger Games, but with a twist of Terminator.  And you're gonna wanna stay long so you're part of the bourgeoisie and not the class of people waiting for bread crumbs wondering what the hell the point of their existence is (to get killed by robots and bio-engineered viruses).",

Turned out well in the end. However, at current I see a few risks on the horizon that weren\u2019t there in the past.  1. Migration away from iPhones in China in favour of Chinese made phones, this demand will likely weaken here.  2. They make a premium product that they sell at a premium price and have been able to escalate prices quickly.  I feel consumers won\u2019t tolerate much more in terms of price increases which would affect top line growth.  3. Lack of new innovative products.  The AR headset while interesting is not likely to achieve wide adoption.  AI is interesting as well but will likely only keep people on their platform rather than entice new purchasers (except those renewing old iPhones).  Still holding for now, but these are the concerns I see going forward.",

There was a story recently that flew a bit under the radar due to all the ass jamming Apple is getting from the EU/DoJ/Litigious Competitors which noted a Surgeon who successfully completed the first surgery aided by a AVP. Apple as a company, while having made racks on racks on racks from becoming a wildly popular consumer brand and status symbol has always had a backbone of being industry standard hardware for many careers. AVP has the potential utility to become a literal HUD and enhancement for untold amount of professional work. Throw in some AI integration and it could be an absolute next evolution of tech innovation for advancing any number of skilled professions. How long will this take? Who knows, a lot depends on applications being built for it and more stories like this of people doing game changing things with it, but the potential is astonishing when you think about it. The price on the AVP is outrageous for a consumer but so is their other top line hardware for professionals.

            "body": "I don't mean this to come off preachy. I myself have lived a life of stock market sin, but I've come to the light and I want others to see the truth as well. \n\nIn this sub we have come to glorify massive gains and colossal losses \ud83d\udcc9.  The typical person here would seem to have a 5-10k dollar Robinhood account, which they eagerly are willing to risk most of on a random earnings event, overnighting weeklies, or dca-ing 0dte against the market until their account reaches -99%. \n\nWhat if it didn't have to be this way? What if someone with a 5-10k cash account could average 100-200 bucks a day in gains rather than just going all or nothing? They would only take 25-100 trading days to double up with a more measured approach to trading. \n\nHow? Well, how about for starters: \n\n1) Weeklies and 0dte are for scalping, not swinging. Yes, when you see COIN or NVDA or whatever the fuck stock you suck yourself off to has a good setup on the intraday: you scalp that shit. You buy a weekly and sit there until you've made a little money and you throw the option back into the sea \ud83c\udf0a after like 10-30 minutes.  \n\n\n\n2) Swinging has a clean technical setup. So, say we want to enter a trade against QQQ in this bull market. The trend is already against it. Would it make more sense to enter short if it was stalling out at like 445 where you would have a closer logical stop, or 434 where you're just jerking yourself off hoping the last 6 months of trend support will break? Praise God. \ud83d\udc4f  \n\n\n\n3) You can accept a loss and you know where you'll take it when you enter a trade. A general rule I've learned in the futures trading community is you never will let a single day take out more than 3 days of your average gains. Preferably less, but we are in the business of risking it for the biscuit so sometimes shit happens. Say you made 200 for the last 5 days, and the next day you get fucked for 600, you're still up 400 and your mental has probably taken a hit but it's better than if you took your account from 5k to 12k overnight then toileted the entire account dca-ing spy puts against an uptrend day. Then you just won't be feeling good about shit for a couple months rather than a day or two.   \n\n\n\nThat's just 3 simple things, my fellow degens.

Then, when you get to a million, almost certainly by not doing anything stupid with the 90K you didn't screw around with, not by making bets, you can make riskier bets with options. But still, you'll almost certainly find it's the sensibly managed part of your portfolio that will get you to real wealth. \n\nThat's risk management, and it works 99% of the time. But the main part of it is to get a decent job first and not be a loser, so you can put at least a good part of 100K in your account every year.

If it can break out next week it will without a doubt hit $1000. The stock did 8% in the last week so it\u2019s not going to take much to push past resistance. Not to mention over 80,000 short positions opened at $950 were liquidated today due to fear. The stock is full speed ahead at this point. Check the order book for yourself. \n\nThis is all just my opinion but I hope some of this could be insightful.

If you've studied the play and done your due-diligence, all to a point where you feel very confident about the play, it's generally OK to buy-in closer to 35%. Anything above 35%, in my experience, risks an \"IV-crush\", regardless if you were correct about the direction and price-action of the underlying. \n\nAn IV-crush is simply when the sentiment of the market goes from highly \"speculative\" to generally \"understanding\". For example, if company YYYY has an anticipated and/or impending big press-release, IV will spike above 35%. Once that press-release occurs, or if it doesn't, the market now \"understands\" what the company is doing and is no longer highly speculative \u2014 when this moment of sentiment transition occurs, the options chain on both sides experiences an IV-crush. The result is almost all options, regardless of ITM or OTM, lose a lot of value. It's possible to survive this, although it's not common. IV is inherently linked to speculation \u2014 when there is no more speculation because the company clears up the facts, speculation goes to a low, and IV follows.\n\nHope this helps...",

                "Sure. Long ass reply though, as this is a very important question and the answer is as nuanced as it is important...\n\nFirstly, volume is largely exchange related. I trade via an API mostly, which means I use a computer program I wrote that interfaces with a single exchange. Since tapping into a large public exchange's endpoints is expensive, I opt to use a lesser-known one. This can create liquidity problems, which you normally won't see with any other asset on popular brokers or direct large exchange trading. Point being, on most exchanges/brokers, derivatives are very liquid typically \u2014 less than their underlying asset, but it would be difficult to find a liquidity gap that can't be explained by something else....\n\nSo, with that said, remember to understand that volume discrepancies can simply be related to \"meta-action\" in the markets: time-of-day, liquidity, the exchange you're trading on, or the broker's liquidity pools.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAnyways, assuming you're talking about just a discrepancy in derivatives contracts' volume, with respect to the derivative type (i.e, call volume higher than put volume), rather than a massive liquidity gap, then the answer is pretty nuanced:\n\n### Consider \"Open Interest\"\n\n***Open Interest (OI)*** is a metric of outstanding derivatives contracts; it is a metric of liquidity. It is not the same as volume, and indicates something completely different. Specifically, it\u2019s the total number of contracts that traders have bought and not yet sold, or sold but not yet covered, indicating the flow of money into the futures or options market. \n\nOpen Interest is a very important indicator within derivatives trading, as it gives you a direct look into sentiment more than volume does. \n\n### Be Weary of Trusting Volume\n\n***Volume (VOL)*** is a metric of activity. Specifically, how many derivatives contracts were exchanged in a certain time-frame (almost always the current trading day). It's important to set this apart from Open Interest, as volume does not distinguish itself between buy-side/sell-side (as inherently for a trade to take place there must be a buy-side and a sell-side).\n\nVolume can be high on the call-side of the chain for many reasons including: negative sentiment, positive sentiment or an ongoing/immediately anticipated implied volatility drop. As market-makers could be flooding the chain by selling a mass amount of calls \u2014 a warning sign that the market expects a downturn, or investors could be simply buying calls with the anticipation that the asset will go up in the short-term \u2014 a very bullish sign. \n\nVolume is also extremely high during expiration moments. For example, ~30mins before the end of a trading day, many traders offload their zero-day assets (as most people simply don't exercise their derivatives contracts, they sell them 30mins before expiry).\n\n### TL;DR\n\n**Volume is simply an indicator of activity, and can be argued that it is a metric of strength of the current trend \u2014 not necessarily an indicator of direction.** To really get a good idea of what people are thinking and what it means, one really has to look at both volume and open interest. \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n### Some Extra Information...\n\n> ***The Entire Chain vs. OI*** \u2014 \n> \n> Low open interest indicates fewer contracts in circulation. High open interest means less contracts are in circulation. \n\n> ***The Call-Side vs. OI*** \u2014 \n> \n> Assuming the Call-Side open interest is significantly higher than the Put-Side, then that is a sign that many traders are \"long\" (bullish sentiment).\n> \n> Conversely, if Put-Side OI is significantly higher, it's a sign that many traders are \"short\" (bearish sentiment). \n\n> ***The Entire Chain vs. VOL*** \u2014 \n>\n> Low volume indicates a stagnant asset; it could mean that the specific asset is not popular, that you're early, and most importantly it could indicate a possible liquidity crisis. \n>\n> High volume is an indicator of an active asset. Most importantly with high volume, given we are viewing this from the perspective of the entire chain (calls and puts @ equal volume), it directly implies volatility.",

AMD analysts model an acceleration to 21.9% growth in 2024 to $30.5 billion.\n\nAnalyst Opinions\n\nNvidia's software moat around CUDA is viewed as a key competitive advantage that will make it difficult for rivals to displace Nvidia's leadership position. For AMD, analysts are optimistic about continued share gains in server CPUs against Intel, and expect AMD to emerge as the clear #2 player in data center GPUs behind Nvidia.\n\nRisks and Uncertainty\n\nIf enterprise adoption of AI is slower than expected or if hyper scalers shift workloads to in-house chips, it would impact growth estimates for AMD and Nvidia. Geopolitical tensions around AI and potential export restrictions are another risk factor.\n\nEarnings and Profit Drivers\n\nAnalysts model Nvidia's GAAP operating margins can reach 64% by fiscal 2027. AMD is also expected to expand margins, with a long-term target of 35% adjusted operating margins.\n\nRead the full article here:\n\n[https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/amd-vs-nvidia-a-comparative-analysis-for-2024](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/amd-vs-nvidia-a-comparative-analysis-for-2024)",

                "Good question.\n\nIt's only my opinion but nowadays, when it comes to options, I tend to only: Sell puts and buy LEAPS as I find that short-term calls decay too fast (theta). If I were to buy any short-term call, I'd do it before earnings but even so you'd need to calculate check the implied volatility (IV) is not too high for your price target. I use this website: [https://www.optionsprofitcalculator.com/](https://www.optionsprofitcalculator.com/)\n\n* For your specific case:\n   * One of the main problems with HIMS' options is that there is not much liquidity. So let's say you want to cash out your position, you will have to pay a premium. Sometimes this can be significant. Which is why I'd rather take a pure long stock position rather than a short-term call.\n   * As far as I know, the main catalyst was actually today with the Fed announcing that it will holds interest rates steady and expect 3 rate cuts. If you bought the call before the decision I think you did fine. This brings up the following question: Should you hold or take the profits? Which leads to my last point.\n   * I have the feeling that since $HIMS became net income profitable, inflows into the stock have shot up. Not only that but I also suspect that on top of that, the stock used to be heavily shorted just because it became public through a SPAC and... Yeah, there was a lot of garbage companies that raised money through SPAC but HIMS is not one of them.\n      * So hard to say if your call expiring in about 30 days is a good bet or not but there are green lights in my opinion, although I'd personally rather buys LEAPS or shares as I don't believe in timing perfectly the market.",

It just crossed off a bunch of signals for me not to jump in. When it went to 3 to 8\n\nTlt and crisp alone got me over 200% each with shares and calls",
                "Thanks a lot, I try to be! This is not advice of course but here is what I see:\n\n* When it comes to specific stocks, not really. I'd say HIMS is still the best opportunity I see. And as you can see I don't believe in diversification at all. There's a lot to say about this company, but it would need a whole post to cover everything. I also own some NVDA, but I consider it to be 'a flexible trade/investment.' This means that I\u2019m comfortable either quickly cashing out the position if it continues to overextend or holding it for a long time if necessary. But it will never be a major part of my portfolio, as the valuation is way beyond what I consider to be reasonable. I have the belief that sometimes (although you want to minimize those occurrences), you need to be exposed in overvalued stocks or you will be left behind with too small of profits compared to those who didn't enter the bubble.\n* If you believe in it, COIN is a good proxy for the overall crypto market and MSTR is amazing if you want to be leveraged.\n* And if you want to do a macroeconomic play, being long SaaS companies and/or OPEN are good proxies too in my opinion. But the market is quite extended, it would be quite a risky play even for a big believer in very low rates environment.\n\nHIMS remains my strongest conviction for the years ahead, although I might change my mind about other opportunities overnight, depending on macroeconomic data releases. (Not to say HIMS is not correlated with the overall market, but I'd be not only very comfortable doubling down on this stock in the case of a drop in this stock but also very happy to do so.)",

                "I wasn\u2019t pooping on your play though homie!!",
                "Tbh it felt like that but I don\u2019t give a damn anyway haha,so yeah no worries bro we good.\n\nHope you can get over 50% gains consistently in the future! Wish you the best."

Everyone is going to be saying \"wtf is it down 10% for after announcing a cool new chip and fomc indicating 3-4 cuts in the back half of the year?\", and that is exactly where the big players want your mindset: denial.

I have been consistently trading from a long time. I do follow all the news. Understand all the options strategies, and a lot of finance terms. I listen to fed calls every week, listen to podcasts, earnings calls. And I can guess direction pretty well too.\n\nLast few weeks I have been sleeping less and less but wake up every day an hour before markets do analysis and I am right on the  general direction at least 60% -70% of the time. I bet calls on Appl, google, when they were at their lows but sold out at small profits. Next day google runs 6% up. \n\nI trade well on high volatility days. Make some profit and stop. And out of nowhere, I don\u2019t know what happens, as soon as i go into a position bigger than I ever normally do on a 0dte markets tend to go tits up in the other direction. \n\nAnd the only SPY/ qqq positions I lost big were puts at 0dte. The first time I lost over 30k in a single day spy went up my option was worth .06 and I was ITM again in 2020. And now I keep buying puts and it just runs the other direction. \n\n\n Like today\u2019s rally, why ? I know markets go up and down. Today, it\u2019s not just NVDA, every sector went up and the inflows too were pretty intense. like my NvDA calls today I exited at a loss even as the price went up. \n\nI don\u2019t know why end up in this position after going through so much trash analysts interviews and readings. I miss out on big profits and take 90% of full losses . \n\nDo you guys never trade big naked option positions. I see some people make wins out of literal crazy bets I want to get fricking 50% win a couple of times. Where you buy something and it goes in your direction not against you. \n\nDo you guys only trade spreads and iron condors ? Or just stocks? How is it working for you? Please help! This is just insane how I spend months together, take incredible stress and time and keep loosing more. What am I missing?",

It could be the 4 hour or any timeframe (I don\u2019t like anything shorter than that unless it\u2019s crypto or something like a meme stock).

            "body": "Today's GTC may have been challenging for many to grasp, but that's actually a positive indicator. This isn't a trivial matter\u2014it marks a significant leap in technological advancement, arguably the most groundbreaking achievement humanity has ever witnessed.\n\nLet's delve into the details. Training large language models has become a focal point for companies like $AMZN, $META, and $NOW. The previous generation of chips, exemplified by the Grace Hopper Superchip, was undoubtedly impressive. However, Blackwell surpasses it by a staggering margin\u2014it's 30 times faster and more powerful. This technological leap places the competition even further behind, effectively setting them back by another decade.\n\nAn often-overlooked aspect is the indispensability of Blackwell for cloud service providers (CSPs). The sheer scale of the task\u2014training the Large Language Model (LLM) with previous technology\u2014highlights the monumental significance of Blackwell. Simply put, there's no viable alternative, and this sets a new benchmark, reminiscent of the \"Steve Jobs\" era where innovation reigned supreme.\n\nFinancially speaking, Blackwell comes at a premium, and demand is already sky-high among major corporations globally. The price tag significantly exceeds that of its predecessor, the H100, but the value proposition is clear. NVIDIA's transition into a software company is a strategic move that ensures recurring revenue for each chip sold, providing a substantial margin and solidifying CUDA as the preferred software platform for developers.\n\nThe impact extends beyond finances to areas like robotics and AI, promising to revolutionize industries such as manufacturing, transportation, surgical procedures, and humanoid robotics. This comprehensive suite of hardware and software products, coupled with licensing and SAAS offerings, underscores the breadth of NVIDIA's reach.\n\nIndustrial companies are rushing to explore the possibilities offered by NVIDIA, recognizing that joining forces with NVIDIA can drive down their Total Cost of Operations (TCO). This aspect, often overlooked, is the true differentiator for NVIDIA\u2014a connective tissue that permeates every segment and underpins its unparalleled value proposition.\n\nUnderstanding the concept of Total Cost of Operations (TCO) is crucial, especially for industrial players. NVIDIA's ability to swiftly identify efficiencies and resolve issues in warehouses or factories highlights its immense value. For CSPs like AMZN, MSFT, GOOGL, ORCL, the significance of TCO cannot be overstated. Regardless of the investment required for NVIDIA chips and the accompanying recurring revenue, it's still a more cost-effective solution compared to alternatives\u2014because time is of the essence, and waiting for a thousand years simply isn't an option.\n\n In conclusion, NVIDIA's Blackwell chip marks a transformative moment in technology, redefining industry standards and solidifying NVIDIA's position as a leader in AI and computing. Its impact extends across various sectors, promising not just technological advancements but also significant financial gains for both NVIDIA and its partners. As Blackwell becomes increasingly integrated into critical systems and processes, its influence on innovation and efficiency is set to shape the future landscape of technology and business. \n\n TL;DR:\n\n* NVIDIA's Blackwell chip represents a monumental leap in technology, surpassing previous advancements by a significant margin.\n* Cloud service providers (CSPs) are heavily reliant on Blackwell for training large language models, setting a new standard in the industry.\n* Financially, Blackwell commands a premium but promises substantial recurring revenue and solidifies CUDA as a preferred software platform.\n* Beyond finances, Blackwell's impact extends to robotics, AI, manufacturing, transportation, and more.\n* Industrial companies recognize the potential to reduce Total Cost of Operations (TCO) by leveraging NVIDIA's technology.\n* Understanding TCO is crucial, as NVIDIA's efficiency and effectiveness offer unparalleled value compared to alternatives, making it a game-changer in various industries.",

Due to the second law of thermodynamics, there is a cost to doing anything. \n\nBut that doesn't mean that change doesn't make things better. Change *can* make things better - when people face the problems it leads to and figure out ways to fix them. That is literally what technology is.\n\nPeople are amazing. What humanity can do is amazing. Not because our tech is magic or shiny. It's that it helps us deal with the challenges we face.

These costs weren't trivial at the time. \n\nGetting behind (a good) change takes a kind of confidence that it will lead to good things and that the inevitable problems CAN be fixed.

I think the biggest takeaway from the last two weeks is we need to stop buying these short term calls. The stock is bound to go up but the sentiment and turbulence in the market is going to keep nvda stuck around $870. Personally I'm going to hold onto my calls for the long term.

But with Blackwell we might see this technique.\u00a0\n\nAnother example is code generation hallucination - before giving to user just test the code with internal interpreter (ChatGPT has a basic form of this). If the code fails to execute then regenerate until it does. Can try 100s of permutations until it gets it right. But again, you need more horsepower.\u00a0",

If the second LLM doing the checking is also hallucinating, it's like asking a liar whether another liar is telling the truth.\n\nIn your other example, when you use AI code generation on even smallish projects, the problem is not necessarily hallucination, it's errors due to the generator using e.g., incompatible or mismatched types, or insisting on using deprecated or non-existent functions.  Other errors we've seen are subtly incorrect logic errors and edge cases which your interpreter method will likely not detect.  \n\nI'm not saying these are impossible problems to solve, but that it's a lot more difficult than people think."

I thought the whole point of going public is to sell some stocks of the company to raise capital. It's hard to believe they will hold onto 90% of the stock even after the lock up, unless it has always been to plan to make only 10% of the company public tradable. Even they sell a small percentage of what they are holding, say 10% more, it will cause the available stocks on the market to double.\n\nI can think of a few reasons why Softbank should sell. But they might be just wishful thinking from my part.\n\n1. Keep in mind that Softbank does not benefit from the current stock price until they actually sell, because the current free float was sold to the market at IPO price.\n2.

                "Here is my take\n\n1. ARM is more like NVIDIA and less like AMD.  They are 90% of the market on mobile and IoT chips.\n2. ARM is AI on the edge/end devices, while NVIDIA and AMD are service provider solutions. Who exactly are they competing with ? Apple, Qualcomm & SAMSUNG pay them royalties for the R&D that everyone chip is based off\n\nThe bet is at some point AI will take off at the edge and if ARM is providing the AI designs, then their revenues will sky rocket because all the edge computing chip makers are chained to them.

Their NAV grows, and their larger holdings provide access to lines of credit. When their book grows, they can also attract more investors and grow their clientele. Actual professional investors want to hold stock forever and have it grow at a steady clip. They don\u2019t trade like this, something needs to go very wrong for them to dump. Having large shareholders sell or buy is also not a leading indicator for price, because very often the reason they are selling is simply to rebalance their portfolio to maintain the desired allocation, or even more often, it\u2019s in their agreements to sell or buy stock in blocks on particular dates. \n\n2. P/E is also not a useful indicator for anything without context, and a high P/E is not bearish. It literally means people are enthusiastic about the stock. If they are enthusiastic for a good reason, the E rises and the ratio goes down as earnings catch up. This is why P/E didn\u2019t matter for TSLA. \n\n3. ARM is pretty good, I don\u2019t know why a huge investment bank needs to choose just one stock to express a thematic opinion. \n\nI\u2019m trying to help here, because I really don\u2019t want you to do this again. I wanted to comment this also for anyone reading because you bring up multiple evergreen arguments that investors often believe but are not very true or useful for actually making money. While huge investors do take profits on companies they lose faith in, there is currently no reason for SoftBank to lose faith in one of the most important infrastructure companies in the world. It would be much different if we were talking about one of the zombie company IPOs from the SPAC craze in 2021, but ARM is of a different breed and it pays to see that.",

They are going in data centers because it's better price and power per compute watt. \n\nPuts on this company going backwards is absurd. Now how fast they can grow is a fair question but the small float addresses that. \n\nA samsung dual screen phone has 13 ARM chips in it. \n\nAI on the edge is going to increase massively. LLM's on the edge will be a thing for robotics and new model hand held devices. The writing is on the wall it's just how long is it going to take you to realize it. \n\nThe strongest part of ARM's business is it's install base - Everything from cars, to TV's to phones and now PC's are all going ARM.",

If I had to make a bet, it's only going to be matter of time before NVIDIA expands into this space. Once they couldn't acquire ARM, this would have been the next logical move.  Now that the revenues are coming in, this would the most sense to invest. Anyone watching the developer conference can understand why AMD stock took a beating today, it's going to be very hard for AMD to compete.  All these partnerships are going to be locked in.\n\nDevelopers are using CUDA, and unless NVIDIA licenses CUDA to ARM, its a real bitch to re-write code.  Anyone who suggests an abstraction layer should revisit the Blackberry 10 lesson. It never ran Android well, it required more compute for the virtual sandbox.\n\nI don't really see how this is feasible.",

            "body": "**Skippable Background:** While at a relatively new friend's birthday party this weekend, a gentleman who I believe was my friend's father struck up a conversation with me. One thing led to another, and he started telling me about his finance guy on Wall Street, about how he knew what CPI was going to be before it was released, that recent increases were driven by car insurance, and more importantly how he couldn't miss when it came to recommending stocks. He had recommended NVDA last year and was now bullish on Cadence Design Systems. \n\nI spent the rest of the weekend digging into Cadence ($CDNS) and decided maybe this guy's guy couldn't miss, at at least not on this. \n\n**Business Overview:** Cadence is a software company that can be likened to the pick and shovel sellers for the California gold rush in the mid 1800s.  Cadence's products and services enable their customers to design semiconductor and electronic systems that are used in data centers and for generative AI, among others.  Demand for Cadence's technology and expertise is driven by increasing complexity of these systems. Clear thesis here. \n\nTheir revenue ($4bn in 2023) is primarily driven through licensing agreements, and 84% of their revenue is recurring in nature, as you'd expect with a software company. They have $6bn of backlog, and expect to realize 54% ($3.36bn) of that this year, which is a positive given substantial proportion of Cadence's software licenses yield revenue over time, making it difficult rapidly raise revenue in any one fiscal period. \n\n[$CDNS revenue \\('21-'23\\)](https://preview.redd.it/w1twzaf9s4pc1.jpg?width=1890&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c1d80ee673329264b4d26074288bf7f06ed5d22f)\n\n**Risks / Competitors:** Lots of R&D expenditure required to keep pole position, but the Company is doing this both organically and inorganically, so I'm not too worried here. From a competition standpoint, Cadence competes with Synopysy (which just acquired Anysys) and Siemens EDA. I don't love the consolidation amongst competitors, but Cadence is also an active acquirer (including the $1.2bn acquisition of BETA CAE earlier this month). \n\nAnyways here's my position - mix of shares and options. Given I only spent the weekend digging in, this isn't even half baked yet. But I like what I've seen so far.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xbazcx99u4pc1.jpg?width=842&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c2b50b8b4790d4ab804695cf965b0705c854bb4b",

If you've seen the movie Margin Call, Jeremy Irons said the way to win is to be smarter or cheat, and he doesn't cheat, so it's helluva easier to just be first. \n\nSome of you know I've been losing my ass on puts the last couple of weeks, about 10k combined on NVDA and others that ended up worthless. I've in the past few days sold more than 50% of my holdings so now I'm 3/4 cash and 1/4 securities. The cash is making ~4.97% on SPAXX so it's not like it isn't gaining but I'm chickening out because I've seen this before - and no I'm not talking about forward PE or anything rational but rather the overall feeling of a feeding frenzy. \n\nI'm holding TSM (also calls for 5/19), INTC (and LEAPS), IONQ, RIVN, SOXL ($21 avg), BA (and calls for Jan '25) HOOD, and SOFI.

It's always a zero sum game. So fucking figure it out quick or you're gonna lose money.\n\nI eventually started becoming profitable at trading but also found out that one of the mining companies I owned was basically involved in slavery. Look it up... Nevsun resources. So I'm just saying maybe my stock was up 30% for that reason.\n\nThe best pump and dump one that EVER got me was a potash company KRN.TO listed on the almighty TORONTO STOCK exchange. This mother fucking CEO Robin Phinney comes on BNN and pumps this fucking shit up to like 20 bucks or something after I'd bought in at like 5 and then for some reason even though they make NO fucking money yet I decided to throw another 5 grand in it in shares(I was very young). This CEO used to work for POT.TO a really big potash company that actually made money so i said what the hell. What do you guys think KRN is worth today? Go fucking look it up. You have Google, right? Anyways I sold before the bottom on that but the idea is EXACTLY the same as it is now... To sell the pen. THE WORLD POPULATION IS EXPANDING WE NEED MORE POTASH. Apparently we fucking don't need that potash that bad because the fucking mine isn't even built yet and the stock is pennies.\n\n0 sum game.\n\nAnyways I'm going to get on with my point here.\n\nThere is a severe lack of meaningful YOLO's. People that don't even fucking read the rules... I see 20-30 YOLO's a week posted with only 2k on the table. I think it's a 10k min for options.\n\nI lost 2k USD this week alone on $AMD. That's a lot of money for me but no body fucking cares. I don't even care.\n\nThere's a severe lack of meaningful discussion.\n\nThere's a severe lack of meaningful memes.\n\nThere's not enough shitty TA in the sub anymore and it's upsetting.\n\nNo one wants to see your 100k NVDA leaps yolo from your half million+ dollar account.\n\nGo try and fucking trade options on a stock with an ACTUAL spread.\n\nCan we get some DD in here instead of 1000 people posting the picture of  Cocaine Cramer and the leather jacket guy eating each other's asses?\n\n What the fuck is this pussy bullshit? And what the fuck are the mods doing not moderating? Are you mods (assholes) too busy offloading your $RDDT shares or are you guys just sucking each other's dicks like usual? I'm talking to you opinion you dumb fuck.\n\n\nBan $NVDA now. It's only fair.\n\nPosition: $NVDA 910p next week.\n\n\n\n",

            "body": "So if I understand this correctly, nVidia is by far the leader in GPUs and can't make chips fast enough to sell them to everyone in the world who wants to create an AI. Furthermore, for any real competition to show up would take 5-10 years for them to design, create and manufacture a competitive chip. Is this correct? Because if this is correct, and now that we know they too are working on an AI...\n\nWhy not just stop selling chips?\n\nThat would cripple literally everyone else in the game and leave them as the ONLY company with proper AI technology for the next 5 or more years. That's a lifetime in AI terms. Not only that, but they can manufacture all the compute they need while doing so. Within 2 months they become the only company that can produce an AI worth using. Now they own 100% of the AI market with literally no competition in sight.\n\nThey win. GG.\n\nEdit: How is this getting so much hate? lol. Do you regards not get it??? Look, if NVDA is the only play in town, and they keep all the compute they make, they'll be able to develop their AI a lot faster than we've seen so far. We are talking AGI within 5 years max. If they are first to AGI, the clone every MSFT software and offering, thereby driving MSFT out of business and taking it all over. Add that 3T market cap to NVDA. Same with META. Swallow them whole. GOOG, eat 'em up. They can continue to devour dozens and dozens of companies by simply having their AI recreate every online service, only better. Then they use their AI to perfect embodied AI and then use them to build anything they want. McDonalds? Gone. TSLA? Gone. V? Gone. Eventually, they rule every market for virtually free because robots don't eat or sleep or complain or ask for money. nVidia becomes the only company on earth. 20T? Shit, I undershot. Try 20Q!",

            "body": "Hi, I want to know what you guys think about this idea on Apple. Let me know. \n\nApple has become one of the most successful companies of all time. They were the innovators of the past but and not really pushing the boundaries like NVDIA. This is a good thing for Apple and what I believe to be their plan. \n\n1. Monopoly\u2019s run shit in America. companies that have established themselves as economic powerhouses continue to take over and consume industries. It\u2019s possible that Apple could be waiting to buy their way into the AI/TECH boom instead of trying to innovate further. \n\n2. APPLE has a massive cash pile and it\u2019s been  growing just as soon as the AI/TECH boom started. This allows Apple to have options when it comes to their next move in the industry.\n\n3. Growing cash pile isn\u2019t good for now. From what I\u2019ve see a growing cash pile means the stock for Apple has underperformed. But as soon as we see Apple start to put that money to use which we have not seen yet it just allows investors stock up on shares. \n\n4. Apple could simply buy their way into the industry and become a top dog again because they have enough money and resources to either buy a company that already has experience with the new age of tech. Or Apple could start to dump money into something new and impactful since they already have more than enough capital and resources to pull it off.\n\nWhat\u2019s my plan?\nI plan on waiting for that cash pile to keep stacking high and as soon as I see significant decreases I will dump money into shares and wait a year or buy leaps.\n\n",

It does but that\u2019s a tiny fraction of its business. That makes it fundamentally different from all the other tech companies that are perusing AI. Anything it does with AI will have to facilitate the purchase of new consumer hardware. \n\nAt this moment in time AI is powered by the data center and distributed to consumers over the internet. This poses some issues. Firstly, there are privacy issues with your data being transmitted to the AI over the internet and the huge cost this entails for AI service providers for the data center. It also doesn\u2019t facilitate the purchase of new hardware. \n\nWhat I think Apple is doing is using Gemini as service to act as a stop gap. The long term play for Apple if to get AI to a point where it can be, at least partially, run locally on their devices. That would push the data center costs onto the consumer, prevent the need to transmit data over the internet, and most importantly would facilitate the purchase of new hardware. \n\nMy guess is that Apple is working on making dedicated neural processing chips for future devices that they will claim power AI much faster and safer than other over the internet AI.

I feel like they let other companies take the risk and if it dose well they use there powerful brand name to infiltrate the market with lack luster innovation on there part but do it in their Apple way. Which usually has the best hardware (build quality) in the market. So with that being said it sort of blows my theory out the water that they will be first to market when it comes to quantum computing. And as of now it seems like IBM a long time competitor of Apple are leading the way into quantum computing. As of recently though Apple released some sort of PQ3 post quantum cryptographic. I\u2019m not sure how deep this goes into quantum computing and I believe we are still 5-7 years away from an actual quantum computer being released to the public.",

                "Just simply not true at all. We haven\u2019t really seen something like the Apple pros where it can be used with your surroundings. I\u2019ve actually used them. And I can tell you without a doubt it\u2019s the same thing as the first iPhone. It starts out not as practical and it slowly starts to get better till they breakthrough to the market and it eventually appeals to everyone. And ofc there is signs of further breakthroughs.

Because of those factors but I really think as we see Apple start to use more money on advancing what they have it will become more practical. That\u2019s really how Apple makes successful products.
