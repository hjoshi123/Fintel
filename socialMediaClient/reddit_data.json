I have been watching the tape for last several months and it pulls back a little bit when news is slow or when they tease something a little bit positive, but then goes back flat.  It's a buy long term, but selling has to wind down first, which won't happen till the next set of heavy news cycle from the upcoming hearings and results.  Sit on this for next month or so, but keep an eye, once it breaks out, Boeing is gonna be hitting $230 (medium term) and $350 within 12-14 months.",

                "The decision to buy Boeing's dip should be carefully considered in light of the company's recent challenges and the potential for a rebound. Here's a summary of the information from the sources provided:\n\n1. **Challenges Faced by Boeing:** The challenges faced by Boeing in 2023 include issues with its defense business, margin pressure, costly charges, manufacturing quality issues, and delivery delays in the commercial airplanes division. These challenges may impact the company's financial objectives and stock attractiveness, raising concerns about its medium-term outlook.\n2. **Potential Rebound Factors:** Despite the recent decline in Boeing stock, there are several potential tailwinds that could support a rebound. The recent incident involving a 737 MAX 9 jet in an Alaska Air Group flight may have caused a spike in bearish sentiment, leading to the stock's decline. However, analysts at The Goldman Sachs Group have rolled out an outlook for 2024 that favors a breakout in the United States manufacturing sector, which could benefit Boeing. Additionally, the backlog of orders in the industry is beginning to rise, indicating increasing demand.\n3. **Valuation and Market Sentiment:** The recent decline in Boeing stock may have been overdone, as 100% of all the jet orders involve either 737 MAX 8 or MAX 10 jets, and none of these orders include MAX 9 jets. This suggests that the market may be bidding up the stock in anticipation of an earnings beat. The article also discusses the valuation of Boeing and Spirit AeroSystems, noting that both stocks are being punished for the faulty MAX 9 incident, despite the majority of their revenues coming from MAX 8 and 10 models. This could indicate that the market is willing to pay a premium for these stocks, suggesting a potential turnaround.",

                "The decision to buy Boeing's dip should be carefully considered in light of the company's recent challenges and the potential for a rebound. Here's a summary of the information from the sources provided:\n\n1. **Challenges Faced by Boeing:** The challenges faced by Boeing in 2023 include issues with its defense business, margin pressure, costly charges, manufacturing quality issues, and delivery delays in the commercial airplanes division. These challenges may impact the company's financial objectives and stock attractiveness, raising concerns about its medium-term outlook.\n2. **Potential Rebound Factors:** Despite the recent decline in Boeing stock, there are several potential tailwinds that could support a rebound. The recent incident involving a 737 MAX 9 jet in an Alaska Air Group flight may have caused a spike in bearish sentiment, leading to the stock's decline. However, analysts at The Goldman Sachs Group have rolled out an outlook for 2024 that favors a breakout in the United States manufacturing sector, which could benefit Boeing. Additionally, the backlog of orders in the industry is beginning to rise, indicating increasing demand.\n3. **Valuation and Market Sentiment:** The recent decline in Boeing stock may have been overdone, as 100% of all the jet orders involve either 737 MAX 8 or MAX 10 jets, and none of these orders include MAX 9 jets. This suggests that the market may be bidding up the stock in anticipation of an earnings beat. The article also discusses the valuation of Boeing and Spirit AeroSystems, noting that both stocks are being punished for the faulty MAX 9 incident, despite the majority of their revenues coming from MAX 8 and 10 models. This could indicate that the market is willing to pay a premium for these stocks, suggesting a potential turnaround.",

Fear of flying is one if the most common phobias. Perhaps our friends in LA would rather just drive to Vegas rather than take the short flight simply cuz \"If it's Boeing, I'm not going\". \n\nOil prices are pissing through the rooftops. Delta has some mitigation to energy prices compared to other airlines, but it's still bad for them. Iran is apparently scheduled to attack Israel or US assets in the ME pretty soon too so that's probably not gonna help things there. Powell is also dead set on cutting rates even though manufacturing and employment are still experiencing a Renaissance, so that just stimulates energy demand even more.  \n\nBonus reason: DAL is near the price it was the last time it went back into the shit hole. \n\nI predict about a 5-6 dollar drop from the open on Monday. 4/12 put options at the money were about 1.40 on Friday's close. I rarely play earnings, but this setup seems pretty good so I'm gonna take a shot at it. \n\nRegards,\n\n-- Tim.",

            "body": "Earnings season is in full swing, and there are some easy pickings if you're on the long side. Here are some key projections:\n\n**CPI:**\n\n* CPI is likely to come in about 10 basis points under consensus expectations per my model.\n* Despite a hot jobs report and rising gas prices, productivity gains and a slowing pace of rent/rent equivalent increases will keep CPI in check.\n* This could put rate cuts back on the table.\n* If this thesis holds, expect the Russell 2000 (RUT) and Nasdaq-100 (QQQ) to rally.\n* Money draining from bonds to stocks this Wednesday.\n\n**Banks:**\n\n* JPM may kick off a bank rally.\n* If the inflation thesis holds, banks will start to look awfully cheap as earnings come through.\n\n**Tech Names:**\n\n* Not every stock will move up - track the fundamentals.\n* GOOG and AAPL are likely to outperform NVDA (this might be a hot take, but it doesn't say anything of long-term prospects, but the fact NVDA susceptible to some bumps, whereas AAPL negativity is peaking just as it has for GOOG).\n* META and NFLX looking pretty solid in the short term.\n* Look for unloved tech names that have been left behind due to the AI hype (e.g. AAPL).\n* Cybersecurity and IT services companies are expected to benefit.\n* Non-AI chip companies offer a safer downside play with potential upside.\n\n**Energy/Utilities:**\n\n* The oil sector is getting crowded, so target utilities and natural gas exposure instead.\n* A note on oil prices: $100 oil is not what it used to be.  US is relatively insulated from the negative impact due to its domestic production.  In fact, high oil and high stock markets can coexist.\n\n**Gold:**\n\n* Save yourselves, there are better plays. Goldbugs will not love this market into the year.  As inflation comes down, so will Gold.  Start taking the profits.\n\nThere may be some pockets to short, like Boeing or Tesla, but be cautious and use stop losses, as these names could get caught up in a broader market rally.  Time to buy, buy, buy!\n\nPS - Some have reached out for recommendations.  I noted some names that will be interesting to invest in here: [Today's game](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bwh7qk/todays_game_strong_buy_signals_from_the_market/).  I am partial to cybersecurity as a sector, given it is likely to benefit from the overall trends I have noted.\n\n&#x200B;",

            "body": "Hi Regards,\n\nI will not be answering messages, but will comment here and there as my time allows. I have more DD, but I do not have the energy to post an essay. Remember, this is not financial advice, but a quick, high level DD, for the majority of people who play options based on emotion or trends, or to hedge their plays (as options were initially intended for).\n\nI may scalp some or I may not. I may post if I do, I may not. If you can afford to hold, hold your options play post earnings. Remember, the day of **EARNINGS** is when the CPI, Inflation Rate, FOMC Minutes are announced.\n\nMy position: $48.5C\n\nThe other guy u/[GarthbrooksXV](https://www.reddit.com/user/GarthbrooksXV/) posted that DAL will 'shit the bed' based on a variety of incorrect data.\n\n  \nHere is why I believe Delta Airlines ($DAL) will go up a modest \\~8% to 12% post earnings:\n\n1. On their previous earnings, they expected a capacity increase between 3% to 5%\n\n2. Full year 2024 EPS expected to be $6 to $7 a share\n\n3. Most of Delta's aircrafts are NOT the Boeing 737 Max. Yes, they have ordered them, but the deliveries are delayed.\n\n4. Those who fly Delta, are aware that this is a top airline. They are a part of the Sky Alliance Team, and most of their airline partnerships charge far more than their competitors (on average).\n\n5. As u/[GarthbrooksXV](https://www.reddit.com/user/GarthbrooksXV/) mentioned a 'Bonus Reason.' Here is mine:\n\nBonus Reason: During AMEX's previous earnings call, the CFO responded to questions with the following responses regarding Delta Airlines ($DAL):\n\n***\"So, I don't -- you know, we'll see whether it's the beginning of a trend or whether it's a data point. But we keep seeing, you know, a lot of strength and, you know, the partnership we have with Delta is working very, very well. Originations, you know, of new cards are very strong. And, you know, cardmembers decided to redeem a bit less in Q4 with airline tickets than they did in the past.\"***\n\n***\"Yeah. So, the Delta product is still going very, very strong. The total billing growth on the Delta product for the full year was up 15%, and we originating a lot of new cards as well. My comment about their, you know, softness in terms of Q4, hard to say whether it's the beginning of a trend or whether it's just a blip.***\n\n***Time will tell. But it's still going very, very strong. And the engagement with the partner -- you know, with the partner is very strong. The partnership is going strong.***\n\n***So, I don't see any softness there at all. And, you know, I will say as well that their credit quality of those new cardmembers remain very strong. I made comments about it's one of the fastest-growing segment on the loan side. and it comes with very strong performance.***\n\n***People who travel a lot and who fly a lot tend to have strong credit quality, and we see that on the loan side, on the spend side, on the origination side. So, you know, I'm not worried about that at this stage.\"***\n\nThis is nothing against the other user, I am just stating my DD since in my opinion, I believe his had a lot of incorrect information.\n\nThis is NOT financial advice.\n\nBest Regards,\n\nBaymax\n\n*How Would You Rate Your Pain?*",

So why could puts be the strategy for next week? Because next week Boeing will be testifying in front of congress (well, a subcommittee in the Senate, but still!). They will be asked about all of the issues that have popped up with the 737 for the past few years and now also the reports regarding the 787 and 777. There is absolutely no good news that can come out next week to redeem them short of another company purchasing Boeing and that is almost impossible to happen as Boeing itself is at no risk of being in financial trouble any time soon even with all the issues they have. While there have been plenty of negative news coming out for Boeing lately, we are guaranteed that no positive news can come out any time soon and as we all know, the market loves to react to news.\n\nTL;DR: Puts on Boeing for next week because finance bros ruined the company.",
